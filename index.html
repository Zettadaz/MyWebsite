        <p style="text-align: center;">This is a webpage about me, Jason Christianson. I am the oldest in my family and I am a student at BYU.</p>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I am a BYU student studying Cybersecurity right now. I went to Burton Elementary, Kaysville Jr. High, and Davis High School. I graduated from Weber State University with an Associate Degree the same year I graduated High School. I was captain of the EASports club for StarCraft BroodWar though we never did get to compete due to a lack of other high schools with a team.</p>
        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p>I am the oldest of 7 children. My mom and dad and the rest of the family lives in Kaysville Utah. I have 6 younger siblings, three sisters and three brothers. They are named Lienna, Trevor, Briella, Janaleen, Eric, and Ethan. My family loves to go camping and fishing so we make sure to do that at least three times a year. My dads parents also have a cabin in Idaho that we travel to quite frequently. There is a river that runs by the cabin and it is fun to drive up to an inlet and ride down the river to the cabin.</p>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I have many hobbies. I love to play video games with my siblings, hang out with friends, and play the guitar. I want to learn how to play the bagpipes in the near future. My family also has 2 ducks that we take care of as pets. We built a house for them to live in the backyard and they roam around finding bugs and eating grass. They also like to swim in a kiddie pool that we have set up for them.</p>
